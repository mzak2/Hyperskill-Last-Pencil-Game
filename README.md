# Hyperskill-Last-Pencil-Game
A project as part of the Hyperskill Java certification, where we are given a prompt to make a game where two players are playing "Pick-up-sticks" with pencils, and build it from scratch.<br>

It is a simple text based game, designed to emulate a "Pick-up-sticks" game between a bot "Jack" and the player "John". Jack the bot will make decisions to win the game based on remaining Pencils. Jack computes the best move based on a modulus computation of the remaining pencils. The game runs entirely in console.<br>

You can view the source code in either LastPencilGame.java or download the "LastPencilGame" file for intellij for easy viewing.<br><br>

Example of finished version running:<br>
